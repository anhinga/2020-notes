# Overview of DMM-related examples in code

## Pre-DMM dataflow animations in Processing

Described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00713 ("Almost Continuous Transformations of Software and Higher-order Dataflow Programming")

  * fixed dataflow graph: https://github.com/anhinga/fluid/tree/master/may_9_15_experiment
  
  * dynamically changing dataflow graph: https://github.com/anhinga/fluid/tree/master/jun_28_15_experiment

## First DMMs: continuous cellular automata 

  * Described in Section 4 (page 7) of https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01050 ("Dataflow Graphs as Matrices and Programming with Higher-order Matrix Elements")

  * Implementation: https://github.com/anhinga/fluid/tree/master/aug_20_15_experiment

  * With fully higher-order matrix elements: Section 4.1 (page 8) of the same paper

  * Implementation: https://github.com/anhinga/fluid/tree/master/aug_24_15_experiment

## First self-referential DMMs:

Described in Appendix D.2 (page 6) of https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00831
