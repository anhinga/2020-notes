# Overview of programming techniques and examples in DMM literature

## Initial reading

Introduction to https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09470 ("Programming Patterns in Dataflow Matrix Machines and Generalized Recurrent Neural Nets"),
that's first 6 pages.

## Accumulators

With one input: Section 1.3.1 (page 3) of https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09470, first use Section 3.1 (page 8) of the same paper.

With two inputs, "accum" and "delta" (or "X" and "DeltaX"): introduced in Section 6 (page 4) of https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00831 
("Notes on Pure Dataflow Matrix Machines: Programming with Self-referential Matrix Transformations").

More details of accumulators with two inputs and a figure: Section 6.1 (pages 16-18) of 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07447 ("Dataflow Matrix Machines and V-values: a Bridge between Programs and Neural Nets")
