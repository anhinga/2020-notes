Abstract:

  * Dataflow matrix machines form a quintessential interdisciplinary field. 
    They emerged as a class of neural machines expressive enough to also serve
    as a viable programming framework. Their historical roots are in the synthesis of domains
    for denotational semantics and vector spaces. There are deep connections between
    vector semantics of programming languages and fuzzy and multivalued logic of
    partial inconsistency. The dynamical systems based on dataflow
    matrix machines exhibit a variety of interesting emerging properties. 

  * As a programming framework, dataflow matrix machines have affinity with
    synchronous versions of dataflow and functional reactive programming.
    They generalize digital audio synthesis based on composition of unit generators
    (transformers of streams of numbers), thus providing potential to generalize
    the style of programming via composition of unit generators to
    visual animations, virtual reality, and eventually to general-purpose
    programming.

  * A class of spaces of V-values (flexible tensors based on tree-shaped indices) is
    extremely convenient for a variety of purposes. V-values allow to bring conventional data structures
    into the neural context, are convenient for hierarchies, are used to allow
    variadic activation functions, and have good potential for use in creating and training
    flexible neural interfaces between pre-existing software systems.

  * When considered as neural machines, dataflow matrix machines are remarkable for
    their strong self-referential facilities, allowing a neural network of this class to analyze
    and modify its current configuration on the fly. They form a natural framework for modular
    neural networks. This suggest a strong potential for their use in learning to learn,
    and also in neuroevolutionary methods.

  * Dataflow matrix machines were discovered and studied by a series of small-scale academic
    research collaborations. To unlock their full interdisciplinary potential, it would be necessary
    to generate a wider interest in this class of programmable neural machines.
