# 2020 design and research notes

This is a continuation of

https://github.com/anhinga/2019-design-notes

2019 design notes contain the initial design for the next generation of dataflow matrix machines, a couple of preprint-like research notes, a white paper, and an interdisciplinary collaborative research agenda.

This repository contains a couple of preprint-like research notes and drafts written in January 2020, and an initial write-up on Julia Flux and Zygote written in February. It seems that Julia Flux/Zygote framework is a better fit for DMMs than more traditional machine learning frameworks, so I am trying to focus on Julia ecosystem at the moment.

Python actually does have a sufficiently flexible machine learning framework these days as well: JAX (which its **pytree** protocol for handling tree-like containers; and there is an ecosystem built around JAX by DeepMind: https://deepmind.com/blog/article/using-jax-to-accelerate-our-research)
