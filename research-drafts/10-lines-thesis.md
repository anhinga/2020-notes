## Inspired by "10 lines thesis" by Jürgen Schmidhuber

The ICLR 2020, had a workshop _"Beyond “Tabula Rasa” in Reinforcement Learning (BeTR-RL): 
Agents that remember, adapt, and generalize"_
(April 26, 2020):

The panel with all 4 invited speakers + Jürgen Schmidhuber starts around 2:40 in the video. 
At 3:36, Jürgen Schmidhuber makes a radical remark that at the end of the day there will be a 
10-line program generating advanced super-human AI, and with the benefit of hindsight 
we'll say that it was obvious and it was strange that we have not found it earlier
(pieces are already there, we just need to join them together, he says, "we are almost there")

Here is my attempt at making a verbatim transcript:

_'It seems to me that many of the basic principles are already understood.
And it's more a question of taking these different well-understood puzzle pieces and 
put them together in such a way that everybody in hindsight will say 
"oh, that's so simple, why did not we think of that half a century ago". 
At the end, it is going to be 10 lines of code or something, 
and it is going to combine [...] the artificial curiosity thing, 
and the metalearning thing, in a totally natural and completely obvious, 
in hindsight obvious, way, and at the moment I strongly believe it is 
just about getting these puzzle pieces together. We have all the pieces, 
and we just have to plug them down in the right positions. We are almost there! 
And in hindsight we'll be able to say: 
"that's so simple, any high school student will be able to learn it... 
how to build a general AI based on these simple principles".'_

This "10 lines metaphor" is not new for him, here is what he said in 2017

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/18/robot-man-artificial-intelligence-computer-milky-way

_“The central algorithm for intelligence is incredibly short. 
The algorithm that allows systems to self-improve is perhaps 10 lines of pseudocode. 
What we are missing at the moment is perhaps just another five lines.”_

#### *** "10 lines" as a meditation topic ***

An interesting meditation exercise is as follows.

Assume that there is a moment (now or in the future), where the thesis
that approximately 10 lines of sufficiently high-level computer code could
generate AI is literally correct. Assume that a good chunk of Internet is
available for such a process (although, it's OK to assume that it is
a static snapshot of a subset of Internet within a sandbox environment;
of course, the question of whether an effective sandbox for such a
situation is at all possible is a whole separate long story and long study).

Assume that this chunk, in particular, contains a fairly large subset of
public github, of arxiv, and of wikipedia. The meditation exercise is,
then, what these 10 lines of code might look like.

This is, obviously, a series of meditation exercises. Each particular
exercise depends on your assumptions about the path by which you and/or
community arrived at the imagined moment in question.
