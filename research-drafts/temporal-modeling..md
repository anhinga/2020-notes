## Temporal modeling

Modeling of temporal evolution of objects, their properties, their structure, and their communities.

### Streams of V-values

One can use streams of tuples of conventional sparse tensors, but it is probably much more natural to use streams of V-values for better generality and flexibility.

### Transformers

Recent improvements in the complexity of Transformers make them suitable for temporal modeling of long sequences:

"Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention", https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16236

### Universal differential equations

Modern mixtures of differential equations and neural networks, such as "universal differential equations".

Julia SciML community is a particularly important hub for this: https://github.com/SciML
