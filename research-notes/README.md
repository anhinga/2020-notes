Title:

_Using streams of probabilistic samples in neural machines_

---

Abstract:
  * We describe a class of neural machines capable of processing streams of probabilistic samples. The samples themselves can be, e.g., compound objects of discrete nature if so desired, and the neural machines in question don't need to embed those samples into vector spaces, but can process them ``as is". 
  * While it is customary to process one stream element per one cycle of a neural machine, the mechanism we describe allows for temporal sparsity, that is, it allows to provide a stream element only occasionally, if so desired. We describe mechanisms allowing to combine streams of probabilistic samples with positive coefficients, with arbitrary real coefficients, and with complex coefficients.
