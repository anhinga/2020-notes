Title:

_Higher-order neuromorphic computations with linear streams (extended abstract)_

---

Abstract:

 There is a rich theory linking the ability to endow Scott domains with a structure of vector spaces and the logic of partial contradictions. The discipline of programming with linear streams (streams equipped with an operation of taking a linear combination of several streams) is rich enough to serve as a general purpose programming platform. We call neural machines working with arbitrary linear streams Dataflow Matrix Machines (DMMs). They provide a programming platform where programs can be continuously deformed. We explore self-modifying DMMs with a dedicated neuron Self handling a stream of network-sized matrices.
